# zoom-clone-ew

Learning and practicing new knowledge acquired with Erick Wendel in his course JS Experts and his JS week`s.

In this project we could see some nice things:
 - Builder pattern 
 - Separation of responsabilities
 - mediaDevices API
 - mediaRecorder API
 - A little of webRTC - the most part of if was handled by the PeerJS
 - Socket.IO

I could highlight the cool things that can facility our day-a-day: Map(), use OO for create some classes even without typoscript, nice way to create closure functions to apply this in our busisness class.

To try, you should follow the steps:
 -go inside the each folder and run the npm ci, so the npm will install exactly the versions of packages this project was created.
 -later inside each folder (public, server and peer-server) run the command: ```npm start```
